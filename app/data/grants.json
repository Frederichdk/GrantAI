Eligible recipients are &quot;affected&quot; (coastal) state offices &amp; public university members of the Piedmont-South Atlantic CESU that currently hold a marine mammal authorization permit from NMFS. BOEM is required to design and implement mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate impacts from regulated activities on protected and managed species, which is challenging due to a lack of data on infrequently observed, cryptic species. Deep-diving, acoustically sensitive cetaceans (e.g., sperm and beaked whales) and poorly sampled species, such as sei whales, are just such creatures, and they inhabit the shelf, shelf-break, and deep ocean waters of the U.S. OCS. The lack of information about their diving behavior and acoustic ecology creates a high degree of variability in their detection probabilities and the analysis of data from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), which is one of BOEM&apos;s primary mitigation and monitoring tools for marine mammals. Verifying cue rates (i.e., a key for PAM analyses) for understudied marine mammals in diverse behavioral states and habitats is thus key in reinforcing BOEM passive acoustic studies nationally. BOEM requires robust, current data to (1) fully analyze and disclose the potential for significant impact from OCS activities at varying spatiotemporal scales pursuant to NEPA, (2) to provide better information for determining whether a species could be jeopardized by an activity and whether that activity could adversely affect designated critical habitat pursuant to the ESA, (3) to provide information that allows better estimation of the potential for incidental take of marine mammals stemming from BOEM-permitted activities to ensure compliance with the MMPA (4) to fulfill assessment and consultation requirements with other federal agencies, and (5) to aid BOEM in making every effort to maintain the health and stability of marine mammals and their ecosystem.

Two of these pinnipeds are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act: the endangered western Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of Steller sea lions and the threatened Arctic subspecies of ringed seals (a third species, the Beringia DPS of bearded seals, was also listed as threatened but the listing was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska). NMFS has the responsibility to foster the recovery of these ESA-listed species and research is necessary to support our recovery programs for these species. Non-ESA-listed pinniped species or populations in Alaska are listed as strategic stocks under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and/or are important as a subsistence resource to Alaska Natives and co-managed by NMFS and Alaska Native co-management partners. Research is also an important component to co-management of these animals. Beginning in fiscal year (hereinafter, &#147;FY&#148;) 2015, certain priority pinniped research in Alaska will be administered through a competitively-funded, merit-based grants program.

    "title": "DoD Lung Cancer Translational Research Partnership Award",
    "description": "The FY17 LCRP Translational Research Partnership Award mechanism supports partnerships between clinicians and research scientists that will accelerate the movement of promising ideas in lung cancer into clinical applications. This award supports the development of translational research collaborations between two independent, faculty level (or equivalent) investigators to address a central problem or question in lung cancer in a manner that would be less readily achievable through separate efforts. One partner in the collaboration must be a research scientist and the other must be a clinician. In addition, one partner in the collaboration is strongly encouraged to be an active duty Service member or Federal employee from a military treatment facility, Department of Defense (DoD) laboratory, or a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center or research laboratory. It should be clear that both have had equal intellectual input into the design of the research project. Multi-institutional partnerships are encouraged but not required. At least one member of the partnership must have experience either in lung cancer research or lung cancer patient care. A proposed project in which the clinical partner merely supplies tissue samples or access to patients will not meet the intent of this award mechanism.Observations that drive a research idea may be derived from a laboratory discovery, population- based studies, or a clinician&#8217;s firsthand knowledge of patients and anecdotal data. The ultimate goal of translational research is to move a concept or observation forward into clinical application. However, members of the partnership should not view translational research as a one-way continuum from bench to bedside. The research plan must involve a reciprocal flow of ideas and information between basic and clinical science.This mechanism is intended to fund a broad range of translational studies, including, but not limited to, the following:&#8226; Studies advancing/translating in vitro and/or animal studies to applications with human samples/cohorts.&#8226; Late-stage preclinical work leading to/preparing for a clinical trial, e.g., Investigational New Drug (IND) application submission.&#8226; Pilot, proof-of-principle clinical trials (must include documentation of an existing IND or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), if applicable).&#8226; Correlative studies that are associated with an ongoing or completed clinical trial and projects that develop endpoints for clinical trials.The success of the project must be supported by the unique skills and contributions of each partner. The proposed study must include clearly stated plans for interactions between the Principal Investigators (PIs) and institutions involved. The plans must include communication, coordination of research progress and results, and data transfer. Additionally, multi-institutional applications must provide an intellectual property plan to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove institutional barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure the successful completion of this award.The Translational Research Partnership Award is structured to accommodate two PIs, referred to as the Initiating PI and the Partnering PI, each of whom will receive a separate award. The Initiating and Partnering PIs have different submission requirements; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work, and other required components. It is the responsibility of the PIs to describe how their combined expertise will better address the research question and explain why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts.Preliminary data to support the feasibility of the research hypotheses and research approaches are required; however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from studies of lung cancer. Clinical trials are supported by this award mechanism and, if proposed, require the submission of Attachment 8, Human Subject Recruitment and Safety Procedures.The anticipated direct costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY17 LCRP Translational Research Partnership Award will not exceed $900,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information.Military Relevance: The LCRP seeks to support research that is relevant to the healthcare needs of military Service members, Veterans, and their families. Military relevance will be considered in determining relevance to the mission of the DHP and FY17 LCRP during programmatic review. Investigators are strongly encouraged to consider the following characteristics as examples of how a project may demonstrate military relevance:&#8226; Use of military or Veteran populations, biospecimens, data/databases, or programs in the proposed research.&#8226; Collaboration with DoD or VA investigators.&#8226; Involvement of military consultants (Army, Air Force) or specialty leaders (Navy, Marine Corps) to the Surgeons General in a relevant specialty area.&#8226; Description of how the knowledge, information, products, or technologies gained from the proposed research could be implemented in a dual-use capacity to address a military need that also benefits the civilian population.&#8226; Explanation of how the project addresses an aspect of lung cancer that has direct relevance to military Service members, Veterans, or other military health system beneficiaries, including environmental exposures other than tobacco.Use of Active Duty Military and VA Populations: If the proposed research plan involves access to active duty military and/or VA patient populations or resources, the PI is responsible for establishing and demonstrating such access. If possible, access to target active duty military and/or VA patient populations/resources should be confirmed at the time of application submission by inclusion of a letter of support, signed by the lowest-ranking person with approval authority, for studies involving active duty military Service members, Veterans, military and/or VA-controlled study materials, and military and/or VA databases. If access cannot be confirmed at the time of application submission, the Government reserves the right to withhold or revoke funding until the applicant has demonstrated support for and access to the relevant population(s) and/or resources. Note that access to a Veteran population for clinical studies may only be obtained by either collaboration with a VA investigator where the VA investigator has a substantial role in the research or by advertising to the general public.",

    "description": "Applications for the Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (PH/TBI) Research Program Announcement (PA) for Workplace Violence in the Military are being solicited by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Defense Health Program (DHP). The PH/TBI Research Program was established in FY07 for the purpose of complementing ongoing Department of Defense (DoD) efforts towards promoting optimal care for PH (including workplace violence across the DoD service areas) and TBI in the areas of prevention, detection and intervention. This includes research to benefit service members, their family members, veterans and other beneficiaries of the Military Health System (MHS). The Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) is administering the application process for this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity, and the United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is issuing this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity for Workplace Violence in the Military and will be negotiating all resulting awards. US Warfighters endure increasingly demanding and high tempo conditions both in garrison and in the combat field of operations in order to keep pace with ongoing wartime mission requirements. In addition to the loss of lives overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other theatre of operations, Warfighters have lost their lives on an Army post stemming from acts of violence in the workplace. The tragic shooting of military personnel at Fort Hood in November 2009 highlighted the need for the DoD to thoroughly review its approach to force health protection and to broaden their historical focus on hostile external threats. The DoD force protection policies, programs, and procedures need to be improved and integrated into a cohesive and comprehensive approach. This Program Announcement stems directly from recommendations yielded from the Independent Review Related to Fort Hood. Specifically, the Independent Review determined that DoD programs, policies, process and procedures that address identification of indicators for violence and radicalization are outdated, incomplete, and fail to include key indicators of potentially violent behaviors. It was also determined that currently the DoD has no risk assessment system available to supervisors and commanders to assist them in the identification, mitigation, and tracking of internal threats. The Independent Review also outlined actions needed to identify behavioral indicators of violence. The primary focus of this Program Announcement is behavioral-based predictors of potential targeted acts of violence in the workplace. Targeted violence refers to deliberate and planned violent acts toward a specific target or set of targets. Such acts may also include threatening or intimidating behavior as precursors to the intended violent activity. Targeted violent behavior is not to be confused with random or impulsive violent acts. The intent of this Program Announcement is not to focus on targeted acts of violence that have previously been extensively studied (e.g., acts of terrorism, sexual assault, child abuse). The primary environment for both studies is the occupational setting. Domestic violence and child abuse are not a primary focus; however, they may constitute a component of workplace violence if the individual is in uniform as they are considered on duty 24/7, and/or if the physical assault occurs in garrison. While not the primary focus, it is expected that the results of both the prospective and retrospective studies will yield data and information that will be valuable to civilian authorities and mental health professionals as they develop policies and protocols to address an ever-increasingly violent society. The public purpose/military relevance of this research is that it is anticipated to lead to approaches that would help to mitigate the risk of potential targeted violence in the workplace.",

Research conducted at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) for the DoN HBCU/MI Program:&#8226; Enhances the research and educational capabilities of HBCU/MIs in scientific and engineering disciplines critical to the defense mission of the DoN,&#8226; Encourages cross-institutional, collaborative participation of HBCU/MIs in naval-relevant research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E), and&#8226; Seeks to increase the engagement of students, including underrepresented minorities, in STEM fields important to the defense mission.This FOA is executed under policy and guidance of the DoN HBCU/MI Program and is administered by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).This FOA seeks to support research efforts that will contribute to the science and technology (S&amp;T) mission and vision of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps while simultaneously expanding the research capacity of participant institutions and engaging students in STEM. In that regard, this FOA is intended for white papers and invited proposals from HBCU/MIs exploring basic, naval-relevant research. The technical content of any idea must align with the following research areas of interest as outlined by the Naval Research Development Framework.Information, Cyber, and Spectrum SuperiorityAn increasingly interconnected force with more rapid and effective decision-making is enabled by persistent sensing, advanced data analytics, digital integration, and assured spectrum access. In that regard, this research area spans three strategic areas:&#8226; Assured Command and Control (C2)&#8226; Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW)&#8226; Full Spectrum Cyber technologiesAssured Command and Control (C2): Assured C2 is enabled by persistent sensing, timely intelligence, and decision support tools that will accelerate &#8220;data to decisions&#8221; timelines. Leveraging machine reasoning and data analytics, an end-to-end approach achieves protected data transport, resilient networking, and assured apps and services that result in trusted information and actions. The need for increased spectral efficiency and diversity, coupled with the information domain, is critical to our naval freedom of maneuver on a global scale.Electromagnetic Maneuver Warfare (EMW): EMW efforts include electromagnetic spectrum management technologies and techniques that fluidly combine communications, surveillance electronic warfare (EW), and electronics to understand and shape the battlespace. Ultra-wide bank systems, which continuously monitor the spectrum, are needed to facilitate optimized use.Intrinsically secure and resilient computing systems with robust computational and communications architectures will provide the capability to manipulate and interpret rapidly growing amounts of data support of C2, Combat Systems (CS), and Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) effects. Assuring secure access to the full spectrum is essential to operate at will or deny adversary access in more complex and dynamic future EMW environments.Full Spectrum Cyber technologies: Full-spectrum Cyber approaches must be developed to protect our networks, data, information systems, and real-time control systems. Total platform cyber protection is becoming an essential element of Information Warfare. Cyber technologies provide the ability to assess and counter potential threats. Future information systems must provide agile capabilities for achieving and maintaining communications and data integrity in rapidly evolving, dispersed, and disadvantaged environments. Computational architectures need more resilient information infrastructure through assured system design, automated defensive tools for advanced persistent threats, hardening of the hosts, and data assurance.Applicable Research Interests:&#8226; Advanced RF electronics and materials&#8226; Communications and networking&#8226; Computational methods for decision making&#8226; Data science and analytics&#8226; Electronic warfare&#8226; Sensors and sensor processing&#8226; Machine learning, reasoning, and intelligence&#8226; Resource optimization&#8226; Precision navigation and timekeepingMission Capable, Persistent, and Survivable Sea PlatformsConcepts, systems, and component technologies that improve the performance and survivability of naval ships/submarines in an increasingly distributed yet interconnected force are critical. New platforms will need to deliver advanced weapons, as well as increased mobility and survivability. Power and energy for surface ships is a key, enduring investment for the efficiency of legacy platforms, while enabling the power requirements of future electric weapons. High-power electric weapons and sensors have advanced significantly, creating technical requirements for dramatic increases in energy management and pulsed power.Computational tools that model the platform&#8217;s interaction with the anticipated operational environment are essential to the development of integrated designs and protections such as stealth, counter-directed energy weapons, tactical decision aids, electronic warfare, and hard-kill systems.Undersea dominance remains a priority as the Navy designs and builds the next generation of strategic and tactical submarines. Resurgence by peer adversaries in ultra-quiet submarine technology is closing the gap in undersea warfare.Platform mobility and survivability is critical to successful operational strategies calling for more distributed forces. Advancements in materials, acoustics, and intelligent control are required in addition to hydro-, electro-, and computational mechanics. Advancements in countermeasures for ships and submarines are also critical.Platforms will become more self-sustaining to extend endurance and forward presence while reducing the logistics tail for fuel. Future platforms must have reduced sustainment requirements and be easier to maintain. Efforts are focused on platform interfaces as well as platform efficiency to reduce sustainment needs. Enhanced interface standards and modularity provide flexibility, ease of maintenance, and upgrades.Finally, affordability permeates all modernization concepts. The development of validated design tools capable of rapidly and accurately analyzing and evaluating novel platforms with advanced system performance characteristics is a high priority.Applicable Research Interests:&#8226; Naval engineering&#8226; Advanced naval power systems&#8226; Advanced survivable sea platforms&#8226; Unmanned sea platforms, autonomy, and power&#8226; Advanced naval materials&#8226; Undersea weapons, counter-weapons, and energetics&#8226; Sea platform environmental quality&#8226; Corrosion controlAviation, Force Projection, and Integrated DefenseSea-based aviation, including platform and weapons research, is focused on new or enhanced capabilities to defined against, and/or deter, disable, damage, defeat, or destroy adversaries at extended ranges and speeds. Offsetting technologies must continue to provide naval forces with an edge in any future battle. In the future battlespace, electric weapons with deep magazines and low cost-per-kill will be required to engage large numbers of threats simultaneously.Directed-energy systems will be used in layered defense to counter ISR capabilities, defeat or destroy threats, both before and during combat.Networked weapons will improve the probability to kill and reduce the need for multiple weapons targeting the same platform. Advanced warhead materials will decrease the size of rounds. Electromagnetic realigns will allow more, smaller, and longer-range rounds.Future naval fires efforts include targeting, decision support and precision strike by air, surface, undersea, and expeditionary forces.Improved aerodynamic control will allow unprecedented maneuverability for unconventional aircraft designs. Advanced aircraft power and propulsion technologies, such as variable-cycle advanced technology, will provide more efficient operation over a wider range of flight conditions. They will also enable technologies for providing the power and thermal management of electric weapons for next-generation aircraft. Advances in structures and materials will allow for reduced life-cycle costs as well as stronger and lighter airframes.Autonomous systems will reduce operational risk and improve mission performance. For today&#8217;s missions, autonomy can improve manning effectiveness and provide options for mission tasks. For future missions, autonomy can provide new persistent, pervasive, and rapid response capabilities to do tasks that would be unaffordable or impractical today.Applicable Research Interests:&#8226; Directed Energy (DE) and Counter-DE&#8226; Aerodynamics&#8226; Flight dynamics &amp; control&#8226; Propulsion&#8226; Structures and materials&#8226; Energetic materials&#8226; Hypersonics&#8226; Autonomy",

    "description": "The U.S. Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support. These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success. The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating. Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population. In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP).DHAPP has successfully engaged over 80 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services. DHAPP is a partner U. S. Government (USG) organization collaborating with the U.S. State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the President&#146;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Working closely with U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV. This BAA allows DHAPP to assist countries where militaries are not funded under PEPFAR. DHAPP&apos;s goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on the drivers of the epidemic specific to the military, and to support the development of interventions and programs that address these issues. DHAPP works with countries&#146; militaries to devise plans based on the following process:&#149; Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs. &#149; Adapt DHAPP support to a country&#146;s need for prevention, care and/or treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on an assessment of the country&#146;s epidemic, and more specifically, in that country&#146;s military. &#149; Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term. &#149; Consider program design by leveraging assets with other country partners who have/had successful prevention, care, and/or treatment efforts. &#149; Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans. &#149; Implement and monitor programs to ensure accountability and sustainability. Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate: &#149; Visible support from the military sector. &#149; Development of plans of action and policies. &#149; Alignment with PEPFAR, as well as national, strategies and priorities.&#149; Increasing awareness within the military sector. &#149; Country military ownership of its activities. &#149; Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, behavioral interventions, reduction of concurrent partnerships, prevention and care of opportunistic infections, male circumcision, changing male normative behaviors, and prevention campaigns. &#149; Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission, counseling, testing, diagnosis and proper linkages to care and support).&#149; Stigma reduction associated with HIV infection. &#149; Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, prevalence surveys, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and strategic information management.&#149; Increasing capacity building.&#149; Promoting sustainability by the partner country. The DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP), based at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, California, provides technical assistance, management, and administrative support of the global HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment for foreign militaries. DHAPP administers funding, conducts training, and provides technical assistance to participating militaries. In addition, DHAPP staff members serve on most of the PEPFAR Technical Working Groups and Core Teams through the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. DHAPP provides HIV program execution and monitors outcomes, with staff that includes active duty military, civil service, and contract personnel. See attachment for full announcement",

    "title": "Scaling the National Diabetes Prevention Program in Underserved Areas",
    "description": "Approximately 86 million Americans, or 1 in 3 adults, have prediabetes. Prediabetes is a health condition characterized by blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. People with prediabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prediabetes is treatable, but only about 10 percent of people who have it are aware that they do. The CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) is a partnership of public and private organizations working collectively to build the program delivery infrastructure for an evidence-based lifestyle change program for adults with prediabetes to prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes. The lifestyle change program is founded on the science of the 2002 NIH Diabetes Prevention Program research study, and several translation studies that followed, which showed that making modest behavior changes helped participants with prediabetes lose 5% to 7% of their body weight and reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% and 71% for people over 60 years old. (http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/index.htm)The CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) is the quality assurance arm of the National DPP. The DPRP plays a critical role in assuring that organizations can effectively deliver the evidence-based lifestyle change program with quality and fidelity. To achieve CDC recognition, organizations must provide evidence they are following a CDC-approved curriculum and achieving meaningful results with patients based on established national standards (http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/recognition/about.htm). There are over 1,200 CDC-recognized organizations across 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands delivering the evidence-based lifestyle change program in-person, virtually, or through a combination of virtual/in-person modalities to accommodate different learning styles and preferences. These organizations are listed on the DPRP website at (https://nccd.cdc.gov/DDT_DPRP/Programs.aspx).The National DPP works toward equal access to the lifestyle change program for all populations at risk. Currently, there are gaps in the national infrastructure related to reaching and serving particular priority populations. Medicare beneficiaries, people with disabilities, men, and racial/ethnic minorities are under-represented relative to their estimated numbers and disease burden. Many live in areas of the country with few or no programs. Where programs do exist, they often lack the expertise necessary to help these populations overcome barriers to successful completion of the program. This is an open competition funding opportunity announcement (FOA) that builds on successful strategies tested in previous FOAs to scale and sustain the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) for general populations. In this FOA, those strategies will be adapted for both general populations, Medicare benificiaries and one or more priority populations in underserved areas.Through a five-year cooperative agreement, CDC will support national or regional organizations with multi-state networks to deliver a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program in underserved areas to adult populations with prediabetes or at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Applicants must identify affiliate delivery sites in at least three states and enroll at least 1000 priority population participants in the first year. Continued growth in sites and participants is expected in years 2-5. Applicants must demonstrate the organizational capacity and experience working with affiliate sites and other key partners to implement and deliver a CDC-recognized lifestyle change program or other evidence-based behavior change program, including documenting program outcomes.Applicants must have demonstrated specialized experience working with general populations, Medicare beneficiaries and one or more priority populations in underserved areas to deliver a CDC evidence based lifestyle change program or other behavioral change program. Priority populations include men, African-Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Pacific Islanders, and non-institutionalized people with visual impairments or physical disabilities. These populations are prioritized because they have been enrolled in lifestyle change program at lower rates despite relatively higher rates of type 2 diabetes. To the extent the general population as well as priority populations have access and are enrolling, a reduction in incidence, or new cases, of type 2 diabetes is anticipated.Previous enrollment of priority population participants does not by itself constitute specialized experience. If applicants do not substantially meet this criteria, they may enter into a formal collaboration with one or more organizations that have this experience. These collaborations must be formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or memorandum of agreement (MOA) that details the respective roles of the applicant and each of the collaborating partners in implementing the required strategies and activities and in meeting the outcomes and performance measures outlined in this FOA. Awardees must implement activities in all 5 strategies: 1) Increase the availability of CDC-recognized organizations in underserved areas; 2) Increase clinician screening, detection, and referral of adults with prediabetes or at high risk for type 2 diabetes to CDC-recognized organizations; 3) Increase awareness of prediabetes and enrollment in the lifestyle change program; 4) Increase retention rates for participants in the lifestyle change program; 5) Increase benefit coverage for participation in the lifestyle change program. By the end of the cooperative agreement, delivery infrastructure will be expanded, closing the enrollment gap so that more priority population participants with prediabetes successfully complete the CDC lifestyle change program, achieve 5-7% weight loss, and significantly reduce their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The announcement is only for non-research activities supported by CDC; applications for research cannot be considered through this announcement.",

    "title": "Distributed and Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Technology (DCIST) Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA)",
    "description": "Army Operating Concepts and roadmaps to 2040 and beyond envision integrating intelligent systems as force multipliers for improving the effectiveness and reach of Soldiers in complex military relevant environments. Recent Army studies have identified that intelligent systems have the potential to deliver significant military value, including opportunities to reduce the number of warfighters in harm&#8217;s way, increase the quality and speed of decision making in time-critical operations, and enable new missions that would otherwise be impossible. Over the last ten years, the ARL has established an Enterprise approach to intelligent systems that couples multi-disciplinary internal research, analysis, and operations with extramural research and collaborative ventures through programs such as the Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CTA), the Micro Autonomous Systems and Technology CTA, and Multidisciplinary University Research Initiatives. The vision of the Enterprise has been to make unmanned systems an integral part of the small unit team and to develop systems that: understand the environment; learn from experience; adapt to dynamic situations; possess a common world view; communicate naturally; conduct useful activity; and can act independently, but within well prescribed bounds. ARL has also been working to scale intelligent systems down in size and enable collaborative systems for realizable dismounted Soldier Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) assets.In extending this vision to 2040 and beyond, it is also envisioned that future intelligent systems will need to exhibit adaptable levels of autonomy and work across large heterogeneous teams of intelligent agents and Soldiers. Teams are expected to have the ability to perceive and learn across highly distributed components, work in complex and contested environments, and assist in making rapid decisions in the presence of large amounts of data. The Intelligent Systems vision addressed by this PA is one that integrates, potentially large numbers of heterogeneous physical agents and Soldiers in the command structure as well as sensor nodes within the collective; that can access data from external sources such as distributed unattended sensors and information from knowledge bases; that can fuse information from these external sources with the distributed and heterogeneous perception abilities of the collaborative team to form and then distribute a collective situational awareness as needed and appropriate; and can then use the distributed and heterogeneous processing and intelligence capability of the team to make rapid, and potentially joint, decisions (both locally and globally) to optimize and adapt missions in the face of complex environments, unexpected events, and adversarial actions. Some basic assumptions are that the system will include:&#8226; Large numbers of agents &#8211; tens to swarms&#8226; Heterogeneous mix &#8211; air/ground, large/small, manned/unmanned, fast/slow, varying levels of cognition, Soldiers in the command structure as well as sensor nodes within the team, smart sensors, and knowledge sources &#8226; Highly distributed deployment over large areas&#8226; Operations in complex, dynamic, varying, and contested environments&#8226; Rapid Operational Tempo to include potential for some components operating at faster than human tempo and decision making speeds This vision for a highly distributed and collaborative approach for future intelligent systems will lead to extended reach, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness against dynamic threats in contested environments and technical and operational superiority through intelligent, resilient and collaborative behaviors. While it is important to develop component technologies, this vision is not about a singular technology or system but rather how to integrate varying levels of autonomy and intelligence with the Soldier across spatially and temporally distributed singular systems, small teams, and even swarm behavior all under one command and control architecture. And, in doing so, augment the capability of the collective well beyond that of any one component within the collective to address the Army challenge of high tempo operation in complex, contested, and unknown environments with little or no supporting infrastructure.",

    "description": "NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD This Funding Announcement is not a request for applications. This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&#8217;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement Number P15AS00797 Project Title Changing Tides &#8211; Bivalve Bioassay and Analysis Component Recipient Alaska SeaLife Center Principle Investigator / Program Manager Tuula Hollmen Principal Investigator Total Anticipated Award Amount $130,000.00 Cost Share None New Award or Continuation? New Anticipated Period of Performance 07/20/2015 through 09/30/2018 Award Instrument Task Agreement Statutory Authority 54 USC 101702(a) CFDA # and Title 15.945, Changing Tides &#8211; Bivalve Bioassay and Analysis Component Single Source Justification Criteria Cited (4) Unique Qualifications NPS ATR Point of Contact Erica Cordeiro OVERVIEW This project is a critical component of a larger project, &#8220;Changing Tides,&#8221; which seeks to identify causal relationships between marine intertidal invertebrate (MII) health, visitor use, and brown bear physiology. &#8220;Changing Tides&#8221; will increase understanding of how anthropogenic stressors may affect both marine intertidal invertebrates (MII) and bear population persistence at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will examine the development of a monitoring tool that uses bioassays to link changing ocean conditions directly to food web dynamics. This will make a significant contribution to the scientific understanding of coastal ecosystems. This project is to complete bioassay analyses and assess select bivalve species&#8217; response to environmental perturbations. These measurements will allow comparison of the health of the clam or mussel populations at different sites, assess their responses and sensitivity to environmental stressors (changes in temperature, pH, contaminant levels), and their energetic value as bear prey. STATEMENT OF JOINT OBJECTIVES/PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN The public purpose for this agreement is to fund a University of Alaska, Fairbanks post-doctoral fellow stationed at the Alaska SeaLife Center, researching the suitability of clams, mussels and other marine invertebrates to serve as indicators of ecological condition. The University of Alaska Fairbanks is a Land, Sea and Space Grant university and an international center for research, education, and the arts. UAF lists as one of their core themes &quot;Research: To create and disseminate new knowledge, insight, technology, artistic and scholarly works.&quot; The Alaska SeaLife Center&apos;s mission is to generate scientific knowledge to promote understanding and stewardship of Alaska&apos;s marine ecosystems. This project assists both the UAF and the ASLC in accomplishing their missions. The bivalve populations that will be sampled in this project are part of the nearshore food web in the marine system that begins with kelps and algaes and culminates in feeding higher trophic level vertebrates such as bears, sea otters, sea duck, shorebirds and other fauna. It is a collaboration between the Alaska SeaLife Center, USGS, Washington State University and the National Park Service. The techniques developed from the work at the Alaska SeaLife Center will be used in the larger &#8220;Changing Tides&#8221; project. Finally, this research is supporting the efforts of the GulfWatch Alaska program, a multi-agency group responsible for the long term monitoring of resources affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. GulfWatch Alaska includes several federal and state agencies including NPS, as well as universities. A final report, several peer reviewed journal articles and an Alaska Park Science article will be produced collaboratively that focus on the importance and vulnerability of intertidal invertebrates, way intertidal invertebrates should be monitored and make recommendations for the timing and distribution of bear viewing and clam harvesting activities. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT Alaska SeaLife Center will provide expertise in the field of bioassay analyses and aquaculture methods; provide all lab analyses and interpretation of results from results; participate in field collections both for specimens for analysis as well as for documenting species distribution and composition; and assign a post-doc to assist in sample collection, processing, data analysis and interpretation. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part of the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: The National Park Service will with ASLC on all aspects of this project related to marine intertidal invertebrates; provide funding for ASLC to purchase necessary sampling equipment for field collections and lab supplies; and provide funding to complete the analyses of samples collected. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &#8211; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &#8211; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &#8211; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&#8217; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &#8211; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &#8211; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: (4) Unique Qualifications Single Source Justification Description: An integral component of the Changing Tides project is a monitoring tool that uses bioassays to link changing ocean conditions directly to food web dynamics. This will make a significant contribution to the scientific understanding and management decision-making within coastal National Parks. The ASLC developed the techniques for bioassays that will be used in this project. No one else has used these techniques. This work is new and unique. The previous work is not fully published and other researchers would lag significantly behind the progress ASLC has made in this field. The techniques to be used were developed expressly for this project in the funded project &quot;Transport conditions and care of razor clams for environmental condition assessment,&quot; agreement P14AC01034. In addition, the same personnel that developed these techniques will be performing the work in this project. This is critical because the continuity of expertise specific to bioassays of mussel and bivalve species of the area is essential to credible data analysis and interpretation of the results in this project. In addition, the specimens necessary to conduct bioassay work must be transported and arrive alive at the facility where the tests will be conducted. The ASLC is more accessible than most other facilities because specimens can be driven straight from Homer to the ASLC in a few hours. Institutions farther afield increase the risk that the specimens will die in transport. Therefore the ASLC is uniquely qualified to conduct the work.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service (NPS), intention to fund the following project activities without competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P16AS00058 Project Title Seabirds as Indicators Recipient Alaska SeaLife Center Total Anticipated Award Amount 170,618.00 Cost Share 0.00 Anticipated Length of Agreement 3 years Anticipated Period of Performance 5/1/2014-9/30/2017 Award Instrument Cooperative Ecosystem Study Unit (CESU) Task Agreement Statutory Authority 54 USC 100703 CFDA # and Title 15.944, Natural Resource Stewardship Single Source Justification Criteria Cited Continuation Point of Contact Erica Cordeiro 907-644-3315 OVERVIEW Seabirds are a prominent constituent of the coastal ecosystem throughout Alaska. They have been considered valuable indicators of changes in coastal ecosystem processes because of their visibility, position within the food chain, diversity of life histories, and accessibility during the breeding season (e.g. Frederiksen et al. 2004, Piatt et al. 2007, Parsons et al. 2008, Einoder 2009). The diversity of marine birds represents a broad variety of foraging strategies and guilds, offering researchers opportunities to select study species that can be used as proxies or indicators of different food web and ecosystem components. Many of the seabird prey species are susceptible to changes in oceanographic conditions, including climate change and ocean acidification, and birds themselves are food for a large number of predators. Many seabird species are also susceptible to human disturbance, in particular oil spills, because they spend large amount of time at the surface of the ocean, in near shore waters or the intertidal zone, and forage on food items potentially susceptible to contamination. Many seabirds breed in colonies, which tie them to very specific habitats and locations during the breeding season, and disturbances and impacts at or near those breeding colonies can have a disproportionate impact on the seabird populations, and the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, their annual life history with migration between the marine and terrestrial breeding habitat positions seabirds as a linkage between the marine and terrestrial systems. Due to their biology and ecology, seabirds have potential to serve as informative sentinels and indicators of marine food webs and health of the marine environment, including climate change impacts on coastal marine ecosystems. As potential stressors to a system such as climate change, invasive species and other anthropogenic factors increase, understanding how a species or community is responding to those changes through changes in productivity and distribution is informative for resource managers trying to assess park or regional resources and appropriate management actions. With the exception of Sitka NHP, all the coastal national park units in Alaska have seabird habitat, and seabirds play a role in their coastal ecological processes. Bering Land Bridge, Glacier Bay, Kenai Fjords, Lake Clark and Wrangell-St. Elias specifically mention marine or migratory birds as resources worth protecting in their enabling legislations. Some parks support threatened and at-risk species for parts of their annual cycle, for example the Steller&apos;s eider (Polysticta stelleri). Our goal with the current seabird work conducted at the ASLC is to make it applicable to all the coastal parks. Many of the species in this research cross boundaries with multiple park units and occur in areas managed by other agencies. For example, some of our work is conducted on Common Murres ( Uria aalge) on Barwell Island, which is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Cape Resurrection, another study site for Black&#194; Legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), belongs to the state. The coastal surveys cover the shoreline of Resurrection Bay and gather information from taxonomically diverse spectrum of marine birds, offering an opportunity to learn about factors affecting marine bird abundance in coastal marine habitats similar to many parks. In summary, the ultimate goal of our research is to evaluate marine birds as indicators of coastal ecosystem condition and change, applicable to a broader network of ocean parks and partner agencies. The results are useful to park resource managers making management decisions concerning not only birds but other marine life. This goal is complimentary to the NPS Inventory and Monitoring program (SWAN) which conducts complimentary work with the goal of detecting changes in seabirds that may occur within the nearshore environment over the next century and determine causes for the observed changes. In 2012 both the ASLC and SWAN became partners in a larger, integrated, ecosystem based monitoring program called the Gulf Watch Alaska Program. The Gulf Watch Alaska program spans an area from Prince William Sound to the KATM coast and includes the KEFJ coastline and Kachemak Bay. One of the key objectives of the program is to determine population abundance and assess population trends of marine birds in these areas. Our project is closely coordinated with and complementary to the broader Gulf Watch Alaska program. The NPS and other agencies possess data collected from Prince William Sound, Kenai Fjords and Katmai, but the data are collected on an annual basis and span a large geographic range. The ASLC uses the same methods, but collects data monthly and on the much smaller spatial scale of Resurrection Bay. Furthermore, our more intensive surveys therefore provide a means to assess the strength of NPS and other Gulf Watch surveys to detect changes in bird populations. In addition, because our surveys are conducted monthly, our data contain a seasonal component other data cannot evaluate. Along with our partners we suspect that several sea duck species are relying on coastal park resources to a great degree in the winter time, when very little data are collected in the parks. Our data will be shared with the parks and other agencies according!y. STATEMENT OF JOINT OBJECTIVES/PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN This research is conducted in the Resurrection Bay/Kenai Fjords area to complement seabird monitoring conducted in the Kenai Fjords region, Prince William Sound, and other coastal areas relevant to NPS. We have two main objectives. 1. Productivity of selected seabird indicator species in the Kenai Fjords area We will assess annual productivity in selected seabird species (Black-legged Kittiwakes and Common Murres) representing different life history and foraging strategies to establish baseline variability and determine interannual trends inproductivity. Our first goal is to develop and refine remote sensing technique for use to monitor and study seabird colonies in coastal parks. Our ultimate goal is to link annual productivity to environmental variability, and to evaluate its use as an indicator of environmental conditions in the coastal marine environment. This work is currently conducted using video cameras and remote sensing equipment installed on Barwell Island (monitoring of Common Murres) and Cape Resurrection (monitoring of Black-legged Kittiwakes). At Barwell, we aim to monitor 30-60 nests annually. We monitor incubation/brooding behaviors, and calculate productivity as numbers of fledglings per egg laid according to Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge protocols. At Cape Resurrection, we monitor a sub-colony of kittiwakes on 17 randomly chosen plots and a total of 149 nests. We monitor presence of adults/chicks, incubation/brooding behaviors, and nest presence. Productivity will be calculated as number of fledglings produced per nest attempt based on methods used in other studies on Pacific kittiwakes (for example, see Hatch 2013). Physical and environmental variables are collected using a combination of video observation, on-site still images, and on-line databases (NOAA, GAKl). Climate data has been obtained from online databases provided by NOAA, the long term time series GAKl, and a local weather station installed in 2014. Climate data obtained from NOAA comes from the Seward Airport and NOAA buoy station 46076, located in open water in the Gulf of Alaska. The Seward Airport reports air temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Buoy 46076 reports air temperature, sea surface tempeqtture, wave height and amplitude, wind speed and direction, and. barometric pressure. The GAKl, located 1lkm from the colony, records water column salinity and temperature on a monthly basis using a CTD (conductivity-temperature&#194; depth) (Weingartner et al. 2013). Work is in progress to integrate kittiwake productivity data with environmental variables. For murres, we plan to summarize preliminary baseline data on productivity and provide recommendations for protocols and feasibility after the 2016 season. Results from this study will contribute to a Master of Science thesis, is presented at scientific conferences, and will be published inpeer-reviewed journals after data collection and analysis is complete. 2. Seasonal nearshore habitat use and trends of marine birds in the Resurrection Bay We will evaluate marine bird use of coastal marine habitats in the Resurrection Bay area using vessel based surveys to document trends and habitat use of marine birds. We conduct vessel based surveys along a transect at 100 m off shore using two observers and a data logger, and record all birds 100 meters to each side and above the boat. Surveys are conducted parallel to shore and transversely across Resurrection Bay once a month for up to 12 months a year. Data collected included: species, count, sex/age when feasible (sea ducks), age when feasible (alcids), weather conditions (cloud cover,.sea state on Beaufort scale, wind speed and direction, precipitation), and identification of primary and secondary observers. We will characterize seasonal and annual trends, link bird distributions with habitat characteristics from ShoreZone mapping data and identify habitat &apos;hot spots&apos;. We will also aim to evaluate bird distribution in relation to seasonal events such as herring spawn in coastal marine environments. Finally, we will conduct double observer and repeat observation surveys in conjunction with NPS staff to calibrate our methods and to assist NPS with method validation for their broader scale coastal surveys. This work represents the 4th year of a 5 year study to evaluate annual variability and interannual trends in marine bird abundance and distribution, with 5 year data series complete in 2016. We will use these baselines to develop a long term ecological study focusing on the health of the nearshore intertidal and benthic system, linking invertebrate community health with marine bird indicator studies. We will need 2 more years of baseline survey data to accomplish this. Upon completion, results from this work will be available for use in park documents such as resource strategies, vulnerability assessments, State of the Park reports, monitoring designs and other planning documents and projects. Results will also be presented at scientific conferences and in a manuscript submitted to a peer-reviewed journal after data collection and analysis is complete.

    "description": "The Naval Postgraduate School Center for Multi-INT Studies (CMIS) has a bold vision to transform the field of intelligence and seeks to vastly improve the current state of the art in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). To this end, CMIS supports innovative, independent research that has the potential to expand knowledge in related areas.As real-time, accurate and actionable intelligence products are demanded by analysts, warfighters, and decision makers, linear, human-intensive processes are no longer sufficient. The capabilities of current and future adversaries, and the dynamism and complexity of the environments in which they operate, necessitate vast improvements in the timeliness and execution of intelligence-cycle processes.Humans do not have the cognitive ability or the time to analyze the vast quantities of multi-source, multi-dimensional data that are now available. Revolutionary decision support, situational awareness, sensemaking, inferencing, reasoning, and visualization capabilities must be employed to expediently unlock the information contained in these myriad streams of data.CMIS envisions a future where cognitive technologies can anticipate strategic and tactical information needs, perceptively orchestrate distributed sensors across every domain (cyber, human, terrestrial, air, sea, space, etc.), and deliver timely and accurate recommendations to kinetic and/or non-kinetic agents (human and/or machine) to employ required actions.This future of intelligence collection and analysis is realized as a highly automated loop with five functions: 1) information about a target is automatically synthesized from large stores of Multi-INT data,2) a model of target behaviors uses this information as evidentiary support of hypothesized activities, 3) information value calculations determine what next information to obtain, and 4) efficient algorithms orchestrate the employment of a diverse set of sensors to collect information that produces increased information and intelligence value, 5) analysts and decision-makers are informed by the automated loop and the automated loop receives information and guidance from the analysts and decision-makers.",

The Department of Energy has the responsibility toaddress the energy, environmental and nuclear security challenges that face our nation. Themission of the Office of Science is the delivery of scientific discoveries and major scientific tools to transform our understanding of nature and to advance the energy, economic, and nationalsecurity of the United States.In the exascale computing timeframe, scientific progress will be predicated on our ability toprocess large, complex datasets from extreme scale simulations, experiments and observationalfacilities. Even at present, scientific data analysis is becoming a bottleneck in the discoveryprocess; we can only assume that the problem will become more so in the coming decade. At themoment, scientists are often forced to create ad hoc solutions where a lack of scalable analyticcapabilities means that there are large-scale experimental and simulation results that cannot befully and quickly utilized. Moreover, the scientists lack dynamic insight into their analyses, unable to modify the experiment or simulation on the fly. How could we enable broadlyapplicable solutions to address these challenges?In this program, we envision that Machine Learning and Understanding may offer the potential to transform basic scientific research best practices, by enabling systems to self-manage, heal and find patterns and provide tools for the discovery of new scientific insights. The goal of this program is to enable and identify basic fundamental research challenges to enable extreme scale machine learning and understanding focusing specifically on high performance computing challenges.",

    "description": "The FY17 PRORP Applied Research Award (ARA) seeks applied research applications focused on advancing optimal treatment and restoration of function for military personnel with musculoskeletal injuries sustained during combat or combat-related activities. It is expected that any research findings would also provide benefit to the general population. To meet the intent of the award mechanism, applications must specifically address a primary FY17 PRORP Focus Area listed in Section II.A.1, above. Awards may not be used to support fundamental basic research. Basic research is defined as research directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward process or products in mind. The FY17 PRORP ARA is focused on applied research, defined as work that refines concepts and ideas into potential solutions with a view toward evaluating technical feasibility of promising new knowledge products, pharmacologic agents, behavioral and rehabilitation interventions, diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, clinical guidance, and/or emerging approaches and technologies. The anticipated total costs budgeted for the entire period of performance for an FY17 PRORP ARA award will not exceed $750,000. Refer to Section II.D.5, Funding Restrictions, for detailed funding information. Research Scope: Research proposed under the FY17 PRORP ARA may include small- to large- scale projects. These awards are expected to yield potential health products, approaches, or technologies positioned for human testing. Upon successful completion, the proposed research is expected to yield knowledge products, approaches, or technologies that have the potential to advance toward clinical translation. Applicants to the FY17 PRORP ARA are asked to consider, where appropriate, the inclusion of large animal studies in their research plan. Inclusion of preliminary and/or published data relevant to the proposed research is required. In addition, investigators must demonstrate logical reasoning. To be competitive, the application must include a sound scientific rationale and a well-formulated, testable hypothesis established through a critical review and analysis of the literature. Studies allowed under the FY17 PRORP ARA may include, but are not limited to: &#8226; Refinement of concepts and ideas into potential solutions with a view toward evaluating technical feasibility of emerging approaches, technologies, and promising new knowledge products. &#8226; Evaluation, maturation, and/or down-selection of potential product candidates (drugs, biologic constructs, or devices/systems) in vitro and/or in vivo. &#8226; Preparation activities needed to support a future clinical trial or regulatory submission. Awards may not be used to support clinical trials. A clinical trial is defined as a prospective accrual of human subjects where an intervention (e.g., device, drug, biologic, surgical procedure, rehabilitative modality, behavioral intervention, or other) is tested on a human subject for a measurable outcome with respect to exploratory information, safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy. This outcome represents a direct effect on the human subject of that intervention or interaction. For more information on how to distinguish clinical research from clinical trials, see the Human Subject Resource Document at https://ebrap.org/eBRAP/public/Program.htm. Investigators seeking support to conduct a clinical trial should apply to one of the other FY17 PRORP award mechanisms, which can be accessed at http://cdmrp.army.mil/funding/default.shtml. Research Involving Human Anatomical Substances, Human Subjects, or Human Cadavers: All DoD-funded research involving new and ongoing research with human anatomical substances, human subjects, or human cadavers must be reviewed and approved by the USAMRMC ORP, Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) prior to research implementation. This administrative review requirement is in addition to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) review. Local IRB/EC approval at the time of submission is not required. The HRPO is mandated to comply with specific laws and requirements governing all research involving human anatomical substances, human subjects, or human cadavers that is supported by the DoD. These laws and requirements will necessitate information in addition to that supplied to the IRB/EC. Allow a minimum of 2 to 3 months for HRPO regulatory review and approval processes. Refer to the General Application Instructions, Appendix 1, and the Human Subject Resource Document available on the electronic Biomedical Research Application Portal (eBRAP) &#8220;Funding Opportunities &amp; Forms&#8221; web page (https://ebrap.org/eBRAP/public/Program.htm) for additional information. Guidelines for Animal Research: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of preclinical research. The standards are described in Landis, S.C., et al. A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 2012, 490:187-191 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/nature11556/). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Projects that include research on animal models are required to submit Attachment 8: Animal Research Plan, as part of the application package to describe how these standards will be addressed. Applicants should consult the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines to ensure relevant aspects of rigorous animal research are adequately planned for and, ultimately, reported. The ARRIVE guidelines can be found at http://www.elsevier.com/ data/promis_misc/622936arrive_guidelines.pdf. Research Involving Animals: All Department of Defense (DoD)-funded research involving new and ongoing research with animals must be reviewed and approved by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Office of Research Protections (ORP) Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO), in addition to the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of record. IACUC approval at the time of submission is not required. Specific documents relating to the use of animals in the proposed research will be requested if the application is selected for funding. The ACURO must review and approve all animal use prior to the start of working with animals, including amendments to ongoing projects. Principal Investigators (PIs) must submit the institutional animal use protocol, IACUC approval of that protocol, and a version of the animal use appendix titled &#8220;Research Involving Animals.&#8221; Allow at least 2 to 3 months for ACURO regulatory review and approval processes for animal studies. Refer to General Application Instructions, Appendix 1, for additional information. Rigor of Experimental Design: All projects should adhere to a core set of standards for rigorous study design and reporting to maximize the reproducibility and translational potential of preclinical research. The standards are described in Landis, S.C., et al. A call for transparent reporting to optimize the predictive value of preclinical research, Nature 2012, 490:187-191 (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7419/full/nature11556.html). While these standards are written for preclinical studies, the basic principles of randomization, blinding, sample-size estimation, and data handling derive from well-established best practices in clinical studies. Use of Military and VA Populations or Resources: If the proposed research plan involves access to active duty military and/or VA patient populations or resources, the PI is responsible for establishing such access. If possible, access to target active duty military and/or VA patient populations/resources should be confirmed at the time of application submission by inclusion of a letter of support, signed by the lowest ranking person with approval authority, for studies involving active duty military Service members, Veterans, military- and/or VA-controlled study materials, and military and/or VA databases. If access cannot be confirmed at the time of application submission, the Government reserves the right to withhold or revoke funding until the PI has demonstrated support for and access to the relevant population(s) and/or resources. Note that access to a Veteran population for clinical studies may only be obtained by either collaboration with a VA investigator, where the VA investigator has a substantial role in the research, or by advertising to the general public. Use Attachment 2 to provide this documentation (see Section II.D.2.b.ii, Full Application Submission Components, Attachment 2: Supporting Documentation ).

    "description": "Background: Non-native and invasive feral pigs severely damage all native habitats on Guam by eating young plants, trampling, creating wallows, and rooting. These activities increase the rate of soil erosion that may impact the coral reefs, which reduce biodiversity. There are scientific findings that the feral pigs harbor diseases that directly or indirectly impact the ecosystem to include the safety of communities where humans reside on NBG. Additionally, feral pigs are known to consume sea turtle eggs, endangered species, located at Spanish Steps, NBG, a protected area that allows sea turtles to nest.Brief Description of Anticipated Work: This Cooperative Agreement includes the following requirements: (1) This project will eradicate feral pigs from NBG Main Base to protect fragile terrestrial and marine ecosystems, wetlands, and turtle nests. The surrounding security fence prevents immigration of feral pigs onto NBG. Therefore, NBG represents one of the few areas on Guam where feral pig eradication is possible. (2) The location for the performance of this Agreement is on, Department of Defense lands and within the Joint Region Marianas Area of Responsibility, NBG, Santa Rita Guam",

The intended outcomes are relevant for military and general public training and educational purposes. The FY17 JPC-1/MSIS MACH Learning Award seeks metrics/evaluation criteria, the definition of those metrics/evaluation criteria, and specific measuring tools to obtain (collect) and potentially analyze the metrics/evaluation criteria needed to develop a sufficient algorithm for use in the prediction of training needs, both in the skill acquisition phase and in refresher training. It is also seeking a proof-of-concept and/or prototype (depending on award vehicle) in which the proposed predictive model works together with incoming data/information from different, well-evidenced sources. The models need to use real data/information/knowledge and need to compare against known guidelines within the relative medical discipline and a comparable, peer-level group.

    "description": "The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship (VBFF) program is sponsored by the Basic Research Office, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)). VBFF supports innovative basic research within academia, as well as opportunities intended to develop the next generation of scientists and engineers for the defense workforce. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) manages the VBFF program for ASD (R&amp;E). To accomplish this task, ONR is soliciting proposals for the VBFF program through this FOA. This FOA seeks distinguished researchers for the purpose of conducting innovative basic research in areas of interest to the DoD and fostering long-term relationships between the VBFF Fellows and the DoD. As defined by the DoD, basic research is &#8220;systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications towards processes or products in mind. It includes all scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs. It is farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress.&#8221; (http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_02b.pdf ) The DoD&#8217;s basic research program invests broadly in many scientific fields to ensure that it has early cognizance of new scientific knowledge. VBFF is oriented towards bold and ambitious &#8220;blue sky&#8221; research that may lead to extraordinary outcomes such as revolutionizing entire disciplines, creating entirely new fields, or disrupting accepted theories and perspectives. Objectives of the program are to: &#8226; Support unclassified basic scientific and engineering research that could be the foundation for future revolutionary new capabilities for DoD &#8226; Educate and train student and post-doctoral researchers for the defense workforce &#8226; Foster long-term relationships between university researchers and the DoD &#8226; Familiarize university researchers and their students with DoD&#8217;s current and projected future challenges &#8226; Increase the number of talented technical experts that DoD can call upon. This FOA is for single investigator grant proposals for basic research in one or more of the following technical subject categories of interest to the DoD. 1. Engineering Biology: Engineering biology is an emerging discipline that is positioned to become a powerful technology for the potential production of DoD-relevant materials, the development of new sensing modalities, and maintaining warfighter resilience and performance. Engineering biology applies biological principles to the engineering of living biological (natural or synthetic) or artificial systems to develop novel systems or products. Revolutionary basic research engineering biology could lead to new capabilities for the DoD in: Specialty Materials- The commercial sector has examples of microorganisms engineered to produce commodity chemicals such as fuels and pharmaceuticals. However, can biological systems be engineered to produce more complex molecules or three-dimensional materials? Do biological systems have unique or more efficient capabilities to produce complex materials and chemicals? Sensing- DOD has unique sensing needs including the need for detecting unusual signatures, clandestine sensing, and sensing environmental biological molecules and chemicals. Biological systems with their molecular interactions and precise control can have an impact in this capability. Antibodies and RNA aptamers have been traditionally applied in this space and are a relatively mature technology. VBFF is interested in new and unique approaches to biological sensing. VBFF is particularly interested in innovative and fundamental approaches to understanding biological process with the eventual goal of facilitating the engineering of biological systems. Multidisciplinary as well as theoretical, physical, biophysical, biochemical, molecular, and synthetic biology approaches are likely necessary to overcome the technical hurdles that currently prevent biology from being a scalable top-down engineering discipline. Basic research that could employ more engineering principles to biology is relevant to VBFF. Ground-breaking basic research that would expand the repertoire of biological engineering platforms from lab-based domesticated prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (E. coli, for example) to more &#8220;wild&#8221; environmental organisms, microbial consortia, as well as single and multi-cellular eukaryotic systems that can be deployed into real-world environments are also of interest. 2. Quantum Information Science: Quantum Information Science (QIS) focuses on the creation, control, and manipulation of non-classical states of light and matter with potential for exceeding classical limits in communications, sensing, metrology, imaging, computing and simulation. The development of QIS was precipitated by the demonstration of a &quot;quantum advantage&quot; in computing due to development of Shor&apos;s factoring algorithm and Grover&apos;s search algorithm in the mid-1990s, which offered quantum speedups (in the former case, what seems to be an exponential speedup). The potential impacts of QIS on DoD capabilities may include ensuring information security, enabling novel materials design, attaining precise navigation and positioning even without GPS, improved sensing, and accomplishing significant improvements in high resolution imaging. Developments of new algorithms that provide a &quot;quantum advantage&quot; are needed for quantum computing to be more than a niche application. Beyond computing, and even beyond QIS per se, of great interest is the development of small- or medium-sized quantum systems to enable the study of exotic physics that could lead to novel future technologies. This program seeks ambitious proposals that are expected to either advance the knowledge of QIS, or to disrupt the current research directions of QIS. Exploration of the limitations of QIS is highly encouraged. 3. Cognitive Neuroscience: Maintaining human cognitive effectiveness and emotional resilience are important capabilities for the DOD since the physical, emotional stress and cognitive demands of warfighters is constantly increasing with the growing volume of data presented by today&apos;s technologies. Loss of neural function due to warfighter brain injury is also of concern. Understanding neural activity for motor and cognitive functions in humans is of interest to support development of neural interfaces for warfighters that lose capability due to brain injury. DOD has several research and development thrusts in the development of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to allow the control of prosthetics to restore warfighter capability after injury. Additionally, the identification of cognitive neuroscience principles of the mind that can be emulated for sensing, pattern recognition and control and as neuromorphic electronic designs are of interest to DOD. Recent advancements in neuroscience have shown that neuronal activity is organized at the molecular, neuron, neural circuit, and brain structural levels. In particular, computational neuroscience work is making strides to use empirical data to model functional activities at each of these brain structural levels. Fundamental neuroscience studies of the molecular and cellular processes that contribute to the cognitive activities are also making great strides to understand the human mind. The VBFF Program is interested in forward-thinking and hypothesis-driven theoretical, computational, neuronal, and molecular basic neuroscience research to study the mechanisms of human cognitive skills. Research on large-scale models of cortical systems and neural-based cognitive architectures capable of addressing human cognitive skills such as attention, memory, spatial cognition, complex motor skills and language processing are also encouraged. 4. Novel Engineered Materials: Engineered materials exhibit behaviors that are not observed in naturally occurring materials, but rather originate from careful designs of the structure. One example is meta-materials with negative index of refraction that can direct and focus light in ways that natural crystals cannot. Other engineered materials include superlattices, quantum dots, and ordered arrays of nanoholes which can form photonics waveguides. Recent demonstrations of structural meta-materials promise unique combinations of physical properties. Understanding and controlling evolution of material behaviors is an area of interest. Conventional modeling and experimental techniques do not take far-from-equilibrium phenomena into account. Understanding and controlling irreversible material phenomena under extreme environments, e.g. high temperatures, high strain rates, radioactivity, etc., may lead to significant advances in materials design capabilities and in manufacturing process development. This program seeks curiosity-driven research with the focus on discovery of new materials that enable transformative functionalities and performance under extreme conditions. 5. Applied Mathematics (theory and experiments) and Statistics: Many crucial DoD capabilities of the future will rely on mathematical breakthroughs made today. Basic research in applied mathematics can have broad-ranging impacts, by laying the basic foundations for progress in multiple areas. Examples of important areas that will require such foundations include, but are not limited to: generalized machine learning; mathematical foundations of deep learning network; common sense enabled artificial intelligence; the analysis and exploitation of very large data sets; the fundamental understanding of the behavior of sociotechnical networks; the understanding of systemic risk in complex endeavors; formal foundations for cybersecurity; new mathematics for encryption and authentication; and, theoretical foundations for compressive sensing. These are only some of the many areas that can benefit from new and innovative research in mathematics, and in turn enable important DoD capabilities in the longer-term future. There is also a continuing need for fundamental mathematical advances that will increase the efficiency and efficacy of computational modeling of physical phenomena, both to understand those phenomena and, ultimately, to inform the engineering design process. Relevant areas of computational modeling include, but are not limited to, continuum mechanics of fluids and solids, computational electromagnetics, and many others.&quot; 6. Manufacturing Science: DoD is interested in innovative research in the broad area of manufacturing science, which is defined as increasing knowledge, understanding, and manipulative capability associated with materials and materials systems with a focus on the practical control of useful physical, chemical, or mechanical properties. Research may include efforts at all length scales that deal with materials synthesis, processing, fabrication, or design of materials systems; modeling and simulation of the manipulation of structures and properties; or tools and instrumentation for characterization of manipulation and its effects. The product of the research should lead to enhanced understanding, knowledge, model materials/structures, or other outcomes that can enhance current fabrication or manufacturing processes or establish a foundation for new processes or fabricable products. Research in materials has entered a new realm in which new functionalities are obtained through controlled processing and assembly of traditional materials, such as metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites by designing and assembling materials systems with precision. For example, metamaterials, which represent novel architectures of dissimilar materials, enable unprecedented manipulation of light, sound, and heat in ways that are not possible with natural homogenous materials. In many critical cases these architectures can only be achieved through precise and repeatable placement of dissimilar materials via processes that require discovery or new knowledge and understanding. The emergence of new material assemblies and structures promises unprecedented capabilities for DoD related applications but poses great challenges to existing manufacturing paradigms. Despite the advancements in the 3D printing/additive process and polymeric self-assembly, it remains costly and time-consuming to manufacture complicated hierarchical and topological structures with dissimilar materials such as metals and oxides, or inorganics and organics. Basic research in processing to produce precision-engineered assemblies of functional organic and inorganic materials is desired to advance the state-of-the-art in this area. Advances in the science base are needed to enable the development of automated prototyping and other manufacturing techniques that robustly manipulate the next generation of designed materials with desired surface, interfacial, and bulk properties. Basic research in processing and modeling for scalable manufacturing techniques is required to permit meter-scale assembly and bulk structure with micro-scale or even nano-scale surface resolution. DoD is also seeking basic research proposals on disruptive and flexible processing and processes potentially applicable to the manufacture of organic and inorganic materials and structures and on the fundamental limitations of scalability, ultimate length scale, and efficiency of manufacturing techniques. 7. Other fields of research with high potential: The list of subjects provided above is by no means a comprehensive list of topics for which white papers and proposals may be accepted. Proposed research in areas of relevance to DoD will be considered (e.g., fluid dynamics, propulsion, etc.) as long as there is a transformative science problem to be investigated and whose solution may open new ways of thinking about the phenomena that are being studied. All applicants should ensure that they propose to conduct basic research as previously defined in this section. Proposed research should focus on developing a deep understanding of fundamental phenomena. Device development or equipment construction or integration is not a suitable end goal in itself; if proposed, it must be integral to research that will advance scientific knowledge. Risk-taking is encouraged; however, all proposals must demonstrate solid judgment and rationale. All awardees will receive a research grant and the title of VBFF Fellow. VBFF Fellows and their students are provided with opportunities that are designed to enhance their understanding of DoD&#8217;s critical research needs and interact with DoD senior Science and Technology (S&amp;T) program leaders. Fellows and their students are expected to attend VBFF activities scheduled throughout the year. These activities may include an orientation meeting, site visits to DoD labs, technical workshops, and an annual meeting to report the progress of VBFF&#8211;sponsored research. VBFF Fellows may also be encouraged to serve as members of DoD advisory boards, panels, or groups.

    "description": "1. Rabies Elimination: In 2016 CDC, Humane Society International, and Christian Veterinary Mission trained 55 vaccinators on alternative vaccination methods (capture-vaccinate-release &amp; door-tO-door), and conducted a 10,000 dog vaccination campaign to evaluate their ability to conduct these methods. The results were encouraging, with post-campaign vaccination coverages measured at 65% - 80%. Data collected during this evaluation has been used to develop an excel-based program-planning tool that is currently being evaluated in 5 countries. The previous three years of evaluation and training have prepared Haiti for implementation of effective mass dog rabies vaccination campaigns. There is a reliable dog population (available down to a community-level). It has been proven that vaccination coverage of &gt;70% are achievable, and the capacities of Ministry of Agriculture (MARNDR) vaccinators can plan cost-effective campaigns. MARNDR has procured 800,000 canine rabies vaccine doses for use in 2017; but funding for logistical implementation and vaccinator&apos;s salary had not been secured. CDC conducted a global feasibility assessment for the elimination of canine rabies (accepted for publication 11512017). In this analysis, assuming continued progress, Haiti is estimated to achieve elimination of canine rabies in under 7 years. To ensure that Haiti continues to progress towards the WHO goal of rabies elimination by 2030, international support is being requested to assist in these final steps towards national rabies elimination. CDC and PAHO will provide assistance to MARNDR to in the vaccination of up to 300,000 dogs as part of a national rabies vaccination program. MARNDR has requested assistance in evaluating the vaccination program and identifying barriers to achieving adequate vaccination coverage. MARNDR will conduct household surveys after the vaccination campaign to assess barriers to dog vaccination. CDC and PAHO will provide technical assistance for questionnaire development and interpretation of findings. MARNDR will collect programmatic data during the vaccination campaign, such as &#8216;dogs vaccinated per hour&#8217; and &#8216;vaccination coverage&#8217; to determine the program&#8217;s success. CDC and PAHO will provide technical assistance for evaluation criteria and interpretation of findings. c) Mission Rabies-Jed Vaccination Program: CDC, PAHO, and Mission Rabies will plan vaccination campaigns in the same manner as logistical approach 2, however in this approach vaccination teams will be equipped with mobile phones pre-loaded with a mobile application that helps to track vaccination activities and locations. The outcome of a successful 2017 mass vaccination campaign is likely to have an impact broader than just within Haiti. The World Health Organization has declared a goal to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030. Per the CDC global assessment, there are few countries better-prepared to achieve this goal than Haiti. No country has declared canine rabies elimination in over a decade (the United States was the last to do so in 2007). The global community needs more success stories to rally behind, and Haiti is on the precipice of being that global focal example. Lastly, proving that Haiti can rally support to conduct an effective campaign (evaluated by CDC), will hopefully provide evidence for donors to continue to support this effort for the 5 - 7 years required to achieve the goal of elimination. Data collection will help design future vaccination campaigns in Haiti and similarly affected countries. If not funded, dog-mediated human rabies deaths will increase in Haiti. The WHO goal of eliminating rabies - not only in Haiti, but other countries will not be realized.2. Zika: Laboratory and Surveillance Enhancement: Additional Zika funding will expand/enhance PAHO&apos;s current Zika project activities for PAHO member countries to support surveillance and diagnostic capacity for arboviral diseases. Specific activities will include the following: a) Provide technical assistance to develop standard operating procedures for diagnostic and integrated surveillance activities; b) Distribution of arboviral reagents to support diagnostic testing; c) Training and consultative support for arboviral surveillance and diagnostic activities; d) Provide technical assistance for arboviral outbreak response; e) Collaborate with WHOCC to provide technical consultation and training and support for national reference laboratories; and D Support the development, implementation and evaluation of diagnostic and surveillance guidelines. PAHOIWHO works through a permanent contract between s Country Office and the Ministry of Health. If PAHO does not receive this funding, arboviral surveillance and diagnostic testing capacity in the Americas will be severely curtailed, putting the public health of the United States citizens at risk for the importation of exotic arboviruses. In the recent past, the Zika virus rapidly swept through South America (21 countries) and has now been identified in specific areas of the continental United States. There have been reports of a serious fetal malformation called rnicrocephaly (a condition in which a baby&apos;s head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age) and other poor pregnancy outcomes in babies of mothers who were infected with Zika virus. Zika virus is the only known arbovirus to be sexually transmitted as well as transmitted via mosquitoes, compounding the ability for this disease to spread rapidly. Anticipating increased cases of local transmission leading to an increased risk to pregnant women and their developing babies, (CDC) activated its Emergency Operations Center and mobilized an extensive emergency response to Zika virus disease. Given the devastating impact of Zika virus and its potential to spread throughout the continental US, and the impending threat of the importation of other exotic arboviruses, it is critical to fund these diagnostic training and surveillance activities to better prepare the US to respond to critical vector-borne disease outbreaks of this nature.",

The phrase &quot;big data&quot; in this solicitation refers to large, diverse, complex, longitudinal, and/or distributed data sets generated from instruments, sensors, Internet transactions, email, video, click streams, and/or all other digital sources available today and in the future.This solicitation is one component in a long-term strategy to address national big data challenges, which include advances in core techniques and technologies; big data infrastructure projects in various science, biomedical research, health and engineering communities; education and workforce development; and a comprehensive integrative program to support collaborations of multi-disciplinary teams and communities to make advances in the complex grand challenge science, biomedical research, and engineering problems of a computational- and data-intensive world. Today, US government agencies recognize that the scientific, biomedical and engineering research communities are undergoing a profound transformation with the use of large-scale, diverse, and high-resolution data sets that allow for data-intensive decision-making, including clinical decision making, at a level never before imagined. New statistical and mathematical algorithms, prediction techniques, and modeling methods, as well as multidisciplinary approaches to data collection, data analysis and new technologies for sharing data and information are enabling a paradigm shift in scientific and biomedical investigation. Advances in machine learning, data mining, and visualization are enabling new ways of extracting useful information in a timely fashion from massive data sets, which complement and extend existing methods of hypothesis testing and statistical inference. As a result, a number of agencies are developing big data strategies to align with their missions. This solicitation focuses on common interests in big data research across the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). This initiative will build new capabilities to create actionable information that leads to timely and more informed decisions. It will both help to accelerate discovery and innovation, as well as support their transition into practice to benefit society. As the recent President&apos;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) 2010 review of the Networking Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) [http://www.nitrd.gov/pcast-2010/report/nitrd-program/pcast-nitrd-report-2010.pdf] program notes, the pipeline of data to knowledge to action has tremendous potential in transforming all areas of national priority. This initiative will also lay the foundations for complementary big data activities -- big data infrastructure projects, workforce development, and progress in addressing complex, multi-disciplinary grand challenge problems in science and engineering.",

    "title": "DoD Gulf War Illness Clinical Trial Award",
    "description": "The FY15 GWIRP is offering two award mechanisms to evaluate potential interventions for GWI: the Clinical Trial Award and the Innovative Treatment Evaluation Award (ITEA). The Clinical Trial Award, described in this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity, is intended to support larger, more definitive (Phase II-III, U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] device class I-III) clinical trials. In contrast, the ITEA supports the initial evaluation of a treatment or intervention in smaller, early phase or pilot clinical trials (Phase 0, I, or I/II), and does not require preliminary data. For information about the ITEA, see http://cdmrp.army.mil/funding/gwirp.shtml. The Clinical Trial Award mechanism was first offered in FY08. Since then, 14 Clinical Trial Award applications were received, and 4 were recommended for funding. The Clinical Trial Award supports execution of clinical trials with the potential to have a significant impact on the health and lives of Veterans with GWI. Health outcomes of interest should include improvements in overall functional status or in symptom complexes (e.g., cognitive function, musculoskeletal/pain symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, respiratory problems, skin abnormalities, sleep difficulties and others) individually and/or as they may interact with each other. Proposed studies may be single-center or multi-center clinical trials. Applications may be submitted by a single Principal Investigator (PI) or by a team of investigators led by an Initiating PI with up to three Partnering PIs. Multiple PI Option: The FY15 GWIRP supports collaborative projects to bring a new perspective to GWI research and/or facilitate advancement of GWI treatments through synergistic partnerships. Therefore, the FY15 GWIRP is offering a Multiple PI Option for this award mechanism. The Multiple PI Option is structured so that up to four investigators, each of whom will be designated &#8220;PI&#8221; and receive a separate award, will work synergistically on a single project. One member of the team will be identified as the Initiating PI and will be responsible for the majority of the administrative tasks associated with the application. The other member(s) will be referred to as the Partnering PI(s) (maximum of three). All the investigators must collaborate to submit a single project examining one or more treatment modalities or comparing untested or novel treatments for GWI symptoms. It should be clear that all investigators have an appropriate level of intellectual input and effort. The Initiating PI should have demonstrated expertise in GWI research, while the Partnering PIs may contribute expertise from a different field that can be applied to GWI. Multidisciplinary and multi-organizational projects are encouraged. If the project is multi-organizational, applications should include plans for communication between investigators at each organization. Additionally, participating organizations must be willing to resolve potential intellectual and material property issues and to remove any barriers that might interfere with achieving high levels of cooperation to ensure successful completion of the project. Application responsibilities unique to Partnering PIs will be identified in the supporting sections of this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity. Applications proposing studies whose principal focus is on the treatment of psychiatric conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), will be administratively withdrawn and will not be funded under this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity. While Gulf War Veterans are affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease) at twice the rate of Veterans who did not serve in the Gulf War, the GWIRP will not accept applications focusing on ALS research. However, applications that focus on GWI symptomatology may include GW Veterans with ALS if the latter disorder is included in the study&#8217;s GWI case definition. [For those interested in pursuing ALS-focused studies, the office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) offers a separate ALS research program (see http://cdmrp.army.mil/alsrp)]. Applications Involving Industry: Applications involving the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry are encouraged whether as Single or Initiating PIs, Partnering PIs or simply named collaborators. Biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies who apply for the Clinical Trial Award, as an individual applicant or as part of a collaboration, are encouraged to leverage their own resources to complement the funding provided by this award.",

The purpose of the Category II, TSA Centers is to provide national expertise for specific types of traumatic events, population groups and service systems, and support the specialized adaptation of effective evidence-based treatment and service approaches for communities across the nation. To date, the NCTSI has developed and implemented evidence-based interventions and promising practices to reduce immediate distress from exposure to traumatic events; developed and provided training in trauma-focused approaches and services for use in child mental health clinics, schools, child welfare and juvenile justice settings, among other service areas; and developed widely used intervention protocols for disaster victims. The work of this initiative is carried out by a national network of grantees &#8211; the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) &#8211; that works collaboratively to develop and promote evidence-based trauma treatment, services, and other resources for children, adolescents, and families exposed to an array of traumatic events. The NCTSN members collaborate with one another, and partner with systems of care where children, adolescents, and families who have experienced trauma receive services in their communities. For more background information on the NCTSN, see Appendix III. SAMHSA has identified six Strategic Initiatives to focus the agency&#8217;s work on improving lives and capitalizing on emerging opportunities. This announcement is part of SAMHSA&#8217;s effort to achieve the goals of the SAMHSA Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative by reducing the impact of trauma and violence on children, youth, and families, and addressing trauma-related issues throughout behavioral health, health, and social service systems. More information on SAMHSA&#8217;s Strategic Initiatives is available at the SAMHSA website: http://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/strategic-initiatives The Category II, TSA Centers program seeks to address behavioral health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities by encouraging the implementation of strategies to decrease the differences in access, service use, and outcomes among the racial and ethnic minority populations served. (See PART II: Appendix F &#8211; Addressing Behavioral Health Disparities.) Children of deployed military personnel have more school, family, and peer-related emotional difficulties in comparison to national samples. Therefore, SAMHSA has identified military families as a priority population under this funding opportunity. The Category II, TSA Centers grants are authorized under Section 582 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

A key component of the RVHAP is to facilitate coordination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as required in Section 1820 (g)(6)(C) of the Social Security Act. RVHAP grant funds are to be used to increase the delivery of mental health services or other health care services for veterans living in rural areas through the use of health information technology. For the purposes of this FOA, grant funds can be used for two primary focus areas: Telehealth Networks (RVHAP-TH): providing clinical services to rural veterans from more distant clinicians including both direct interactive tele-consultations and store-and-forward applications of telehealth service; and/or; Health Information Exchange Networks (RVHAP-HIE): activities to support the transfer of clinical information for veterans in rural areas to other providers both within VA and its electronic health record system and private providers who are involved in their care with the goal of improving care coordination for the rural veteran. RVHAP goals are as follows: To utilize telehealth and health information technology to enhance access and quality of mental health service and other healthcare services to veterans residing in rural areas. These services include crisis intervention, detection of post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and other signature injuries which meet the needs of rural veterans. The services provided with RVHAP grant funds are in conjunction with veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) initiatives; To utilize telehealth and health information technology, including electronic health records, to help improve care coordination for veterans who are seen by both the Department of Veterans Affairs and private health care providers through the sharing of clinical information that is compatible with VA privacy and security standards and uses established methods of health information exchange (HIE) currently in use by VA; To expand existing networks to provide access to mental health and other services to rural veterans via partnerships with other healthcare entities such as: critical access hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers, rural health clinics, State hospital associations, home health agencies, mental health service providers, pharmacists, local Government agencies, private practice physicians, and other providers who demonstrate the ability to provide access to health care services to rural veterans;",

    "description": "The Gulf War Illness Epidemiology Research Award mechanism is being offered for the first time in FY15. The purpose of this award is to support population-based research to obtain a better understanding of mortality, morbidity, and symptomatology over time in Veterans deployed in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War and afflicted by GWI. While individual symptoms experienced by ill Gulf War Veterans can vary from person to person, the types of symptoms reported are comparable and typically include some combination of widespread pain and headaches, fatigue, cognitive impairment, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin abnormalities. GWI case definitions published to date may be improved through the consideration of additional epidemiological data describing symptom onset, duration, severity, and laboratory findings. The Gulf War Illness Epidemiology Research Award will support hypothesis-driven or discovery-based research into mortality, morbidity, and symptomatology and/or how these have changed or progressed over time in the Gulf War Veteran population compared to rates and patterns of change with time in appropriate control populations. Topic areas of interest under the Gulf War Illness Epidemiology Research Award include but are not limited to: &#8226; Mortality (rate and causes) &#8226; Descriptors of symptomatology (e.g., duration, frequency, severity, etc.) and changes to those associated with GWI &#8226; Clinical diagnoses and laboratory findings &#8226; Symptom clustering and subgrouping &#8226; Gender and racial differences The April 2014 report of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans&#8217; Illnesses (available online at http://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2014/04/RAC2014.pdf) notes that Gulf War Veterans exposed to nerve gas release and oil well fires have elevated rates of death due to brain cancer. However &#8220;very little other research has yet been conducted to determine rates at which Gulf War Veterans have been affected by other medical conditions of possible concern, including neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson&#8217;s disease, other cancers, sleep disorders, adverse pregnancy outcomes or rates of birth defects in Veterans&#8217; children.&#8221; Therefore, studies proposed under this award may also address questions related to medical conditions co-occurring with GWI or related to Gulf War Veteran offspring; however, the primary focus of the study must be epidemiological characterization of the Gulf War Veteran population. The GWIRP intends to fund studies that address broad populations, or comparative populations that can inform one or more of the topic areas listed above. Studies that address small populations, populations associated with very limited catchment, specific military units or geographic areas of deployment, or limited sets of symptoms, markers, or effects must be well justified as to why the scope has been specifically limited. Revisiting previously studied cohorts to generate or extend longitudinal data is one example of a reasonable justification.",
